# Gemini Guidelines: dincamihai.github.io

## Persona & Positioning
* **Role:** Lead/Staff Backend Engineer & Architect.
* **Core Competencies:** Distributed Systems, Data-Intensive SaaS, Technical Leadership, and the **Servant Manager** philosophy ("manage work, not people").
* **Servant Management in Practice:** Actively protecting the team's focus by handling operational overhead (support, releases, roll-out strategies) and performing background refactoring to unblock new feature development.
* **Storytelling:** Use the **SPAR** (Situation, Problem, Action, Result) framework to describe professional experiences. **Do not use explicit labels** (like "SPAR") or introductory titles in the final CV. Present the narrative through the structural flow of Situation, Problem, Action, and Result. Focus on the business impact and architectural trade-offs behind technical decisions.

## CV Content Guidelines
* **Factual Integrity:** Only include verified facts. Do not assume, invent, or extrapolate details about infrastructure, performance metrics, or compliance status without explicit confirmation.
* **Non-Evaluative Tone:** Avoid subjective adjectives or adverbs (e.g., "successfully", "significantly", "deep", "complex"). Let the facts of the actions and outcomes speak for themselves.
* **Exasol Narrative:** Focus on the evolution from a monolithic control plane to a decoupled, event-driven architecture (AWS Step Functions, SQS, SNS). Highlight the shift toward better customer isolation, reduced release friction, and global multi-region expansion.
* **The Solution:**
    * Event-driven architecture (Step Functions, SQS, SNS) built in parallel to the legacy system.
    * Phased rollout strategy: enabling specific operations for targeted customers to ensure stability and control.
    * Custom billing/metering engine extension to support new instance families.

## Strategic Alignment
* **Target Audience:** Companies looking for technical leaders who understand high-load, data-intensive backends and can drive clarity in complex, ambiguous technical situations.
* **Tone:** Pragmatic, professional, and direct. Prioritize "why" and "how" over simple technology lists.
