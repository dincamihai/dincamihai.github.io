Summary
-------


I am an Engineer with a diploma in Information Engineering.

I have experience in Web Developmont, Systems Programming, APIs and Machine Learning (traditional and Deep Learning).

I mainly use Python, but I also have Javascrip (Front-end), Java and C++ knowledge. As well as Scala (Functional Programming), Rust and Golang.

Engaged in organizing the team, always trying to improve the work processes.

Able to decompose complex tasks, evaluate, implement and coordinate with the team.

Since I'm interested in Machine Learning and Data Science, I have invested significant time to learn about these topics.

    + Python: Flask, Django, Plone, Zope, Jinja, Peewee, pytest, Nose
    + Javascript: Backbone-js, Marrionette-js, Underscore-js, JQuery, Highcharts, Handlebars, coffeescript
    + DB: Postgres, hstore, MySQL, Virtuoso(RDF database), SPARQL, MongoDB, Redis, CouchDB
    + Golang
